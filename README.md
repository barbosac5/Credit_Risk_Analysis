# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with Unbalanced classes by using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn. For this challenge, I oversampled the credit data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE. I also undersampled the data using the using the ClusterCentroids algorithm and SMOTEENN. Finally, I analysed the data and comared the two algorthms to predict credit risk. 

## Results 
### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
For Deliverable 1, I was tasked with evaulating three machine learning models by using resampling to determine if any of the models (RandomOverSampling, SMOTE, and CLusterCentroids) are better at determining credit risk.

### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
For Deliverable 2, I used the combined approach of over and under-sampling with the SMOTEENN algorithm to determine if the if these results form a better approach at predicting the results from Deliverable 1.

### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
For Deliverable 3, I used the imblearn.ensemble library to train and compare two different classifiers (BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier) to predit credit risk.
